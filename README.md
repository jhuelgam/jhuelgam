... different approaches to problem-solving
a dissertation on Optical Properties of Metallic Nanostructures
**LaTeX** mathematical expressions

I worked as scientist [here] https://www.nochedelasestrellas.org.mx/docs/int/china/2014/cartel/cartel6.pdf
--->
I hold a B.Sc. in Physics at the Faculty of Sciences, UNAM.
I modeled an optical response of gold prolate nanoparticles, implementing a Fortran code from NASA.
The Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) is an attractive characteristic of metal nanoparticles which is a collective oscillation of conduction band electrons.
The plasmon frequency is given by:

$$
\omega_p =  \sqrt{ \frac{Ne^2}{\varepsilon_0m_e}}  \
$$
